# Lung-Disease-Predictor

### Title :  Prediction of lung diseases by Data Analytics

### Problem Statement :
- Built a machine learning model using algorithms such as ANN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and predicted severity and type of lung disease along with simplistic visualisation using flask. 

### Features :
- Used Numpy, Scikit-Learn, sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, and Jupyter Notebook to build model and run prediction. 
- Analyzed various disease datasets such as COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), Asthma, and Emphysema collected from hospital and medical facilities in Pune area which include pulmonary tests such as spirometry test.
- The model also predicts the severity of the disease. Based on the severity, the medical staff can provide proper treatment.


Kindly refer to the static folders which has the snapshots of the analysis performed on the dataset.
